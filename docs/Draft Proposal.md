## About the project

My initial thoughts about the project is to predict taxi fares which would helpful for the user to plan his trip. <br>

I would like to apply couple of machine learning algorithms like Linear regression, XBoost, RandomForest on the data and compare their performances using Mean Absolute Error. Finally pick the best performing algorithm. <br>

I would like to implement a webpage where it takes information like source and destination from the customer then provides the estimated fare for the trip. <br>

I would like store my data in the S3 bucket of AWS and acces it in my python program. <br>
