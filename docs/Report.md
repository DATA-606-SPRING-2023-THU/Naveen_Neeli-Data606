#  UMBC Capstone Project 
## Taxi fare prediction using interactive web page

## Background Information:
Utilizing taxi services in our day to day life became routine, but do you ever wonder why fare prices fluctuates even you travel in a 
regular route every time. The reason behind it is simple, the fare is dependent on various factors. Finding and utilizing those factors to 
build a similar system all about my project.

A fare is the cost that a person pays to use a public transportation system, such as a train, bus, or cab. The system in place to decide 
how much each individual passenger utilizing a transit vehicle at any particular moment is required to pay is known as the fare structure.
The total fare depends upon various attributes like distance, day of week, hour, duration etc. 

## Problem Statement:
Giving user an interactive page to provide source and destination information. Predicting the appropriate fare for the ride using 
machine learning model and reverting back to the user with fare display in USD.
